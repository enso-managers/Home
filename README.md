# enso designs mechatronics and software

enso stands for 'engineered software'. 
We support you in the design of innovative 'high-tech' products. We harmonize business objectives and technical possibilities. 
We specialize in requirements management, system specification, system architecture and project management. 
We work closely with interaction designers, development service providers and quality managers. 
We support projects in the early stages or bring them back on track when problems arise. 
We work in and on the system development process.

## Goals

Build products that perform their tasks effectively. That stand out through attractive and well thought-out operation. That prove themselves through a clear internal structure. That have fewer rather than more functions. That give pleasure!ï»¿
